Module 19 Challenge: Clustering Crypto<br/>
Presented by Laura Bishop (TLCLauraB)<br/>
<br/>

## Introduction:

In this challenge, I will showcase my proficiency in Python and Unsupervised Machine Learning methodologies by applying KMeans clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a dataset. Through the application of KMeans, I will group data points into clusters, revealing hidden structures within the dataset. Additionally, PCA will be employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data, highlighting the principal components that contribute most to its variance.

I will then use that refined data to answer the provided questions.

## Workflow:

There was little-to-no ETL for this assignment, everything being provided through the starter code.

I received help and support from my fellow Data Viz classmates during class time, through Slack, and via our Discord server. I regularly attended both the before and after-class office hours. I reviewed the recorded class sessions of Module 19.1, 19.2, and 19.3. I struggled with the Composite Plots, even after reviewing their documentation. I also had to familiarize myself with IPython visualization.
